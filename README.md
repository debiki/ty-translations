In this repo, you'll find translations of Talkyard to other languages (other than English).

All translations are supposed to be here. Will move the translations from the main repo, to here, some time later.

The CLA at `docs/CLA-v2.txt` is the same as in Ty's main repo (which is, as of April 2023, accessible here:
https://github.com/debiki/talkyard/blob/main/docs/CLA-v2.txt).
